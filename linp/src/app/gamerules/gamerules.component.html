      Linq is a party of game of bluffing and
      collusion for 4-8 players, ages 10 and up.
      In Linq, two players assume the role of spies
      who are attempting to identify one another
      via secret code words. All other players take
      on the role of double agents, whose goal is
      to identify and confuse the spies by
      deciphering their secret code.

        Briefing phase
        Take a matching card from each deck and
        set the two cards aside. They should be
        identical: verify by comparing the numbers
        on the top-left corner of each card.
        Take a number of double agent cards (the
        ones with the question marks) equal to the
        number of players in the game, less two,
        and shuffle them together with the spy cards
        that were just set aside.
        You should have one card for each player in
        the game: Two identical spy cards, and a
        double agent card for each remaining player.
        Distribute one card to each player.
        Action phase
        The action phase consists of two rounds. In
        every round, each player, beginning with the
        start player, will say a word. It is this word
        that the spies will try to recognize, and the
        double agents will try to bluff. You can say
        any word (regardless of how silly) including
        proper nouns or conjugated verbs, but you
        may not say the code word itself, or any
        word that contains it.
        In the second round, each player must
        repeat the word he said in the first round,
        and then say a second word

          Linq is a party of game of bluffing and
          collusion for 4-8 players, ages 10 and up.
          In Linq, two players assume the role of spies
          who are attempting to identify one another
          via secret code words. All other players take
          on the role of double agents, whose goal is
          to identify and confuse the spies by
          deciphering their secret code.

          Briefing phase
          Take a matching card from each deck and
          set the two cards aside. They should be
          identical: verify by comparing the numbers
          on the top-left corner of each card.
          Take a number of double agent cards (the
          ones with the question marks) equal to the
          number of players in the game, less two,
          and shuffle them together with the spy cards
          that were just set aside.
          You should have one card for each player in
          the game: Two identical spy cards, and a
          double agent card for each remaining player.
          Distribute one card to each player.
          Action phase
          The action phase consists of two rounds. In
          every round, each player, beginning with the
          start player, will say a word. It is this word
          that the spies will try to recognize, and the
          double agents will try to bluff. You can say
          any word (regardless of how silly) including
          proper nouns or conjugated verbs, but you
          may not say the code word itself, or any
          word that contains it.
          In the second round, each player must
          repeat the word he said in the first round,
          and then say a second word

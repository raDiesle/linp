That's exactly how it works.


Let's explain it based on the spy theme :

The mission of the spies is to find other and not get caught :

If they find each other they get points
If they get caught they lose points

The mission of the counterspies is to find the spies and sabotage their meeting

If the spies don't find each other they get points
If I bluff a spy, I steal one point from him
If I find the two spies I get points from them

To show that I didn't catch them by chance I can reveal their password to get one "bragging" point ..
